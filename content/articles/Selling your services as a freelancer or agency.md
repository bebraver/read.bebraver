# Selling your services as a freelancer or agency
It starts by creating an outline of what value you are providing a client with. It is setting out your stall, which is not to be mistaken for listing what services you offer, how long you have been doing great things for and how you go about your business.

It’s very clearly telling an interested party what value they can expect you adding to their enterprise.

Once they get that high level abstracted understanding of what you are about, you can start leading them down the rabbit hole - sorry - funnel.

## “What problem are you solving for me?”
Next, what problem(s) are you solving for clients. This is an illustration of how you have applied or can apply yourself to deliver the value. It could be a case study and there maybe better ways to get your story across without muddying the water. Be concise and give them a clear idea, perhaps something they can see themselves in.

## “How did you just do that? Amazing!"
Once you have shown how that value is delivered, you can start showing people who is behind it or expand into how exactly you are operating, if this is something important to differentiate yourself with. Clients expect you know how to manage things and deliver with certainty - nothing to shout out about, unless you have found a way to do it much better or quicker or at much reduced risk, cost or what ever has added value.

## “You have mad skillz, kid.”
Finally, show what key skills you and your team can bring to the table, and perhaps showcase what makes you different to another competitor. Do you happen to have an award winning designer or super hot developer? Great, say it and don’t forget to clarify what value this gives to the client. Just having some great people doesn’t mean squad to a client unless you can tell them what they get more, better, quicker, safer or less cost.

Incidentally, having something nicer looking, smoother working or easier to use is not really clear unless you translate it into business value. Why is something that’s nicer to look at or easier to use getting me more business or making it more likely to get conversions?

## “What more can you give me?”
People care about value and feel great when they understand what that means for them, especially when you can sweeten the deal by giving added value. But first, they need to understand what the value proposition is. Otherwise, it’ll be hard to agree on a cost and timescales.

Why do you need two weeks for this? How come it costs more than that bloke I met down the pub? Well, because you go the extra mile and you care so much more about producing something awesome of course. The sad reality is, clients don’t really care. It doesn’t make them money unless you can show them how your extra care and passion translates into profit, market share or risk mitigation. 

## Final thoughts
It’s not what you want to say, it’s what they need to hear to be confident in you being the right person or team for the job. 

It’s hard as a freelancer to compete with agencies, because the value you add is naturally less compared to a whole team. You are also more focussed, cost less and carry much less risk.

It’s difficult as an agency to compete with nimble freelancers, because you have to provide much more value, cost more and take longer. You need to show how you provide results faster and tackle business problems more comprehensively.

Maybe, the best of both worlds for a client is a collection of multi-disciplined freelancers coming together as an agency?
