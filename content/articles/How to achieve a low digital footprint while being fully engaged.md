# How to achieve a low digital footprint while being fully engaged
Keywords: Counter Cyber OpSec Privacy InfoSec Guide How-to

I could bore you with an interesting lead-in or story I just made up, or perhaps some form of disclaimer. But I won't waste your time. I know why you are here, and I am watching you(1). So let's cut to the chase.

**Caveat emptor (naturally)(2)**

## Basics
### Addresses
Never use your home address and avoid using main business ones when registering for anything, especially domain names.

Use a proxy service where possible or use mailing addresses only with forwarding or collection (don't collect or send somebody else).

### Money and shopping
Select a bank that offers to do business fully by digital means or postal mail. Some of the latest startups have digital id checks and require no paperwork bar an address to send the credit card to. There's no real way to avoid this, but there is if you just want to do some shopping.

For example, you can buy vouchers in shops and pay cash. Use a disposable email address when redeeming them and either a fake or mailing address (e.g. mailbox address but don't sign-up).

Switch cash to digital currency, put a little in each of the top 3 to spread your risk. Bitcoin is a whoopie and accepted widely. Then pay for services online using that, most don't need a physical address and those that do... you know the drill.

Most e-tailers only use addresses for billing, and digital currency don't need it, so you can use what ever is a valid address (some verify if it exists).

### Email
Use disposable email addresses and a browser with privacy protection (e.g. ad and tracker blockers). You will need lots, often, so don't get lazy and keep it mixed. Make sure to hide your IP or use providers that are truly privacy friendly and don't track IPs fully.

Avoid services for email, vpn and hosting based in the countries signed-up to mutually sharing citizens digital data. Switzerland is good, Germany too for a lot of stuff but I'd only choose it with fully privacy friendly organisations.

## Publishing content
Avoid using script based websites with CMS, like Wordpress, Drupal, etc. Anything with a database has a big attack vector. Scripts are complex and combined with databases make for juicy targets. Use github or similar to host your static html website for free and with good privacy. Avoid javascript if you can. Keep it simple, stupid :)

## Storing stuff
Cloud storage is convenient and risky. Avoid it if you can and roll your own. Use free file hosting services, combined with locally encrypted files and folders. Use GnuPG or SSL (AES256+) for encryption and keep your private key safely tucked away offline (e.g. USB key in a firebox).

## Sharing stuff
Use places like sync.com or TresorIt.com if you really need cloud convenience or struggle with GPG. Some is better than none and some done well beats better done badly. Beware of risks around losing access or all your data, as well as increased attack vectors. Keep it K.I.S.S. and don't use disposable email addresses for this (d'uh).

Tarsnap is neat for secure remote backups too, come to think of it.

## Social networking
Social media is everywhere and so are Facebook and Google's trackers. Beat them with a fully privacy optimised browser (don't keep cookies, use blockers, stay in private mode, use the latest stable version!). Turn off JavaScript and never accept third party cookies. Use a disposable email address to setup a profile, keep a list of profiles to follow on a spreadsheet or text file - don't follow them or add as friends online.

If you have to add a friend, build a few fake personalities and alternate between them. If you can, make your profile as unrecognisable as possible to other 'friends' and tell the persons you want to engage with your profile ID (just one, use the others for other friends or browsing). Try to avoid using the same profile too often or for other things, as social networks live off building up very detailed profiles, which are sold and can be used in cyber attacks.

## Personas
In general terms, create personas where you need to (social, shopping, etc) and don't share those personas for other purposes. Use encryption (ideally GPG) and keep your data backed-up in three separate (physical) locations and providers. Keep your keys and strong pass-phrases in secure offline locations, ideally in three separate ones also and for the truly paranoid, encrypt your keys with another key and keep them in three separate locations. Do not reuse or share locations - are you keeping up still?

## Bottom line
That's right, keeping a low profile is hard work and don't be precious about abandoning locations or providers. If you read this far and still keeping up, your business - what ever that is - may depend upon speed and being sufficiently prepared to kiss a server or persona good bye. That's why we may have a couple for redundancy, in a dormant state to activate quickly. You will  need to learn to be quick and plan to be compromised. Test yourself, by regularly evaluating tactics and your strategy overall.

But why bother with all this? You have nothing to hide, right? Nobody would be interested in attacking you or your data. Because you are nobody, so the best way to make sure of that is being nobody ;-p

## Epilogue 
But what if you are somebody?

That's a topic for another post. You are welcome to hire me if you can't wait or require a more dedicated service.

Get in touch, safely(3)
And don't forget, you can find me on Wire, Signal, Telegram and iMessage. Post an article or comment by secure message instead of looking for a comment function. You could also use Hackernews or (shudder) Reddit.

## Footnotes
1 | This was added for strategic dramatic reasons and I was considering digressing terribly for a moment but stopped myself. There'll be another post on this for sure. If you didn't feel slightly uneasy, you are either not doing this infosec stuff right (yet) or you are dead inside (possibly related to your professional background). In any case: be more paranoid, live longer and have more fun.
2 | Yes, technically that was a caveat. Stop being pedantic and enjoy yourself ðŸ¤£ {sarcasm}
3 | Get a disposable email or phone, send me a text or hook up to one of the services I am on, then add my number. You could also meet me IRL and exchange GPG key signatures over a tea or ale.
